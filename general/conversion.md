# Eurorack Conversion 

## This is a document filled with notes for converting
between Moog voltage standards and Eurorack. 

# Gate/trigger

Moog uses S-triggers. These use a momentary short to ground to 
'trigger' the envelope generator. This is unlike the 
Eurorack standard in that the voltage is momentary 
(not continuous as it would be for gate, which lasts
as long as a note is held). 

A converter cable is sold at synthesizers.com:

# CV

Eurorack uses 0-7V for CV. 

Moog uses the volt/octave standard like Eurorack, 
but uses -5 to +5 volts (Eurorack generally* uses 
-2.5 to +2.5 V, though this is consistently 
violated, making the "standard" more of a guideline). 

# ADSR EG

Eurorack generally uses 0 to +8V; Moog uses... something else.
