# Notes on System at Large

This system is most likely (given the dates of the modules and the 
information I've found online) a Synthesizer 1 system from 1968. 
This model was not designed to map out the sonic universe in great
detail, but is an excellent synth for teaching students the fundamentals
of synthesis. 

Given this, the accessories I'm going to propose will seek to 
expand the unit's functionality with regards to sonic expression.
