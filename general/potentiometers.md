# what to do about the Moog's potentiometers? 

## The problem itsel: 

The problem is most likely to be oxidation. This issue plagues 
carbon potentiometers in particular (cermet resistors and pots 
are more impervious to this sort of thing.) 

## Solution

If the potentiometer is unsealed, open it up and get the dust
out. Apply some kind deoxidizer and then a bit of lubricant. 

## Things to buy: 

DeoxIT (from CAIG Laboratories)  is a good product:

Faderlube is something else that is advised. 

## Possible issue: 

* the destruction of the potentiometers (these are old devices
and have long outlived their expected lifespan)

* manual disassembly and repair is not something you plan to 
do more than once (it's common for potentiometers to break during 
this process anyway)
