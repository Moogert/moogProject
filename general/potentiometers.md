# what to do about the Moog's potentiometers? 

## The problem itsel: 

The problem is most likely to be oxidation. This issue plagues 
carbon potentiometers in particular (cermet resistors and pots 
are more impervious to this sort of thing.) 

## Solution

If the potentiometer is unsealed, open it up and get the dust
out. Apply some kind deoxidizer and then a bit of lubricant. 

## Things to buy: 

DeoxIT (from CAIG Laboratories)  is a good product:

Faderlube is something else that is advised. 

## Possible issue: 

* the destruction of the potentiometers (these are old devices
and have long outlived their expected lifespan)

* manual disassembly and repair is not something you plan to 
do more than once (it's common for potentiometers to break during 
this process anyway)

## potentiometers that should maybe replaced instead of cleaned: 

### 904-A

5K ("Control Voltage"), 50K ("Regeneration")  ("AB Mod Pot") --> (...as are most of these...) 

### 901-B (x2)

10K with a second deck (not sure of the technical term for this) ("Frequency Vernier")

### 902 (x2) 

5K

 ### 901 

5K (no label), 25K ("Width of pulse")

### 901-A 

5K (no label), 2.5K ("width of pulse")

### 911 (x2) 

3x 1 meg ohm pot (T1,T2,T3), 25K (Esus)

### NOT CLEANED: 

901-A, mixer/attenuators
