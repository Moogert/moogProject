# This is for current efforts. 

I am currently investigating the power source's reliability. My reasoning for this
being, of course, that a synth can't work without good power, and bad power will 
make any other efforts pretty pointless. As of right now, the power source is shot. (Or, pretty close to it.) 
Investigating other options for powering the synth for the time being. ("...for a few dollars more...")

## PLAN OF ATTACK: 

### move linearly through the synth. I plan to test the oscillators next (as controlled 
from the keyboard).

Apparently, the power supply (in this case, the Moog 909) sends out GND, +12V, and 
-6V out. +12 is on pin #1, GND on pin 2, -6V on pin 3. Some modules use -10V on pin 14. 

## The next step: 

* get capacitors for the power supply. (Or, I could just get a Bel-power unit and 
be done with the power supply forever...) The Bel-power power supplies are highly 
regarded in the modular community; they can be bought at:
