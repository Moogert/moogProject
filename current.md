# This is for current efforts. 

I am currently investigating the power source's reliability. My reasoning for this
being, of course, that a synth can't work without good power, and bad power will 
make any other efforts pretty pointless.

Apparently, the power supply (in this case, the Moog 909) sends out GND, +12V, and 
-6V out. +12 is on pin #1, GND on pin 2, -6V on pin 3. Some modules use -10V on pin 14. 

## The next step: 

* Figure out how to get the power source out of the synth or get a testing device 
into the synth. Hook everything up and see what needs to be done (if anything). 

* Talk to someone in engineering and figure out how to test a large power supply
using portable gear.  

* Test everything; met with Andrew Diao about this. Details to follow. 

* Should the power supply end up bad, there are other options out there (the most 
tantalizing of which being to scrap the Moog power supply and get a new one- Power-One 
sells power supplies that are rated for professional use and are international).
