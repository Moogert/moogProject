# This is for current efforts. 

I am currently investigating the power source's reliability. My reasoning for this
being, of course, that a synth can't work without good power, and bad power will 
make any other efforts pretty pointless.

Apparently, the power supply (in this case, the Moog 909) sends out GND, +12V, and 
-6V out. 

## The next step: 

* Figure out how to get the power source out of the synth or get a testing device 
into the synth. Hook everything up and see what needs to be done (if anything). 

* Talk to someone in engineering and figure out how to test a large power supply
using portable gear.
