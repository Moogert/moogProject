advised.

We want a 0313.500HXIDP fuse (I think) 

250V, 1/2A, 313 (?) fuse

"Pull every power strip off, and, starting with the oscillators, power them back up, test each
stage, and see if the fuse stays good. It may be that one of the modules blew the fuse. Fuse may 
not have blown, it may just have been banged up."
