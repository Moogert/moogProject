## Notes for Moog 950 Keyboard Controller

This controller comes (or, at one point, probably came) with 
a 950B tuner, which could be used to tune each individual note. 
We don't seem to have this any more, though there is perhaps hope of 
constructing a device that is controlled digitally. (This is not 
of great importance right now.) 

DOCUMENTATION: yes

A copy of the sales brochure is in the folder under this one. 

## STATUS: 

don't talk to me about this thing

...This is, quite possibly, the most irksome aspect of this entire project
so far. The keyboard controls everything else, and the fact that I can't
rely on it to effectively troubleshoot other systems is a bother. 

I (usually) get a trigger out of it, which is good. However, notes 
are not reliable, and even trigger gives some trouble at times. If there's 
one part of this system I would rather ditch, it's this.
