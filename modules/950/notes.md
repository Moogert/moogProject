## Notes for Moog 950 Keyboard Controller

This controller comes (or, at one point, probably came) with 
a 950B tuner, which could be used to tune each individual note. 
We don't seem to have this any more, though there is perhaps hope of 
constructing a device that is controlled digitally. (This is not 
of great importance right now.) 

DOCUMENTATION: yes

A copy of the sales brochure is in the folder under this one. 

STATUS: unknown

PLANS: 

Hook up a power supply and measure the response of the keys.
