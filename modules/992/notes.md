# Notes

The Moog 992 module is unmarked on our edition. On our system it's the third module
to the right of the power source. 

DOCUMENTATION: yes

We will probably need to find some way to replace the lamps here. Manufacturers no 
longer seem to make them (though I think I can ask the Moog folks if they have a
supplier now that they are making reissues).
