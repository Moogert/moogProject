 # Moog 907 Fixed Filter Bank

## DOCUMENTATION: 

yes 

## STATUS: 

sorta works. Everything but the 1000, 2800, 500 bands seem to be OK. 

High-pass filter seems a little buzzy, unit seems to emit more noise 
than I would like, but I'm not sure if that's normal behavior or not. 

### 2800 band

15k potentiometer is bad. Not sure if there's anything else.
Will try some spray cleaner and see what happens.
