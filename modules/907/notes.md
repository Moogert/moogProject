 # Moog 907 Fixed Filter Bank

## DOCUMENTATION: 

yes 

## STATUS: 

OPERATIONAL 

High-pass filter seems a little buzzy, unit seems to emit more noise 
than I would like, but I'm not sure if that's normal behavior or not. 

NOTE: There's a lot of hissing coming out of this thing, for reasons 
I'm not sure of. I'm going to ask about this.
