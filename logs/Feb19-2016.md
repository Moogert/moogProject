Met with Martin Brooke (faculty in ECE department) today- discussed 
the power supply at length. Determined that a fuse was broken (may or
may not have been blown), will need to replace both fuse and fuse holder. 

Prof. Brooke was optimistic about project, estimated that restoration 
process will be relatively straightforward. 

Power supply should be in good condition, can't say for sure right now. 

Suggested going through synth linearly, starting with oscillators and 
moving through towards everything else. This seems to be a good way 
of doing things, and (now that the power supply is fixed) I think 
that is the plan I will adopt.
