...For starters, I'm behind on documentation. Things that have transpired: 

* I made the Moog work with the eurorack standard! It's not a Eurorack module by any stretch of the imagination, but I can output trigger voltages ('gate' in modern parlance) and CV into the Moog and get pitches out of it. 

* The PSU now works! (whee). It's taken way too long to get reliable power into this thing...

* I've placed an order for parts and things (mostly potentiometers), which should greatly improve Misty's tactile response and reliability. Calibration has been temporarily postponed until parts get in (which just seems to make sense to me.) 

* I'll be presenting the Moog at Moogfest- the cool thing is, the Moog doesn't actually have to make noises during this time, which makes my life much easier (I was preparing for a full audio demo, which was starting to make life look something other than tranquil)

* The Moog is now MIDI-compliant (yee), courtesy of the Expert Sleepers FH-1 and the Fakhoury family (thx so much you guys, I really don't know how to thank you). There's another MIDI-CV converter coming in soon (thanks to the Innovation Co-Lab at Duke), though that has yet to be implemented  

* I also "repaired" (zip-tied) the 950 keyboard controller into a cohesive unit (stuff was flopping all over the place inside of it). This is not a permanent solution, but should suffice for the time being. 

...I think that's about all. Documentation is often correlated to free time (or a lack thereof).
