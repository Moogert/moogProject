Ordered capacitors and Bel-power power supplies from ECE parts request website. 
Sent an email about the authenticity of 901-B oscillators, trying to ascertain 
what components should be replaced with abandon, if I should try and hold out 
for anything vintage. (Odds are I'll just try and order new parts, but I figure
it's worth asking.)

Have been absent in part due to illness. (Food poisoning is no fun.)
