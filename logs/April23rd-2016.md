Been a while since I've done any documentation; health issues plauged me since the 8th but (praise God) 
that's over with now. Seems like I've spent the better part of this week sending emails related to this 
project (instead of actually soldering things). 

At any rate- I'm working on sourcing switches for the 'From 2' switch on the CV routing section. 
It ain't cheap, that's for sure. 

working on securing studio time. Trying to get people to buy me fancy gear for recording. 

One recent development is the possible failure of the filter bank's capacitors, which would 
be responsible for the filter's hissing (which I need to evaluate again, by the way).

I'm making a list of possible potentiometers to replace, any orders that are going to take 
place need to happen soon. 

working on calibrating VCAs, unfortunately the old PCB systems weren't labeled, so 
I've been spending (perhaps more than I'd planned) some time trying to trace out the 
PCB to figure out where to put meters and things. (Also trying to figure out what trim-pot
does what...) 

Good times. More to come. Things are starting to heat up.
