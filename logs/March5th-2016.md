Got a response from @robotmakers on the Muffwiggler.com forums. Explained how to 
install a Bel-Power power supply cheaply and easily. ("Cheap" being a relative 
term here..." A link to the discussion is below, but I think that this is 
honestly going to be the best option for the time being:

going to see if I can get bench power supply to power the synth for the 
time being. May work with Jason Kim on this to prevent the electrocution of 
myself or the destruction of poor Misty. 

All for now. More later.
