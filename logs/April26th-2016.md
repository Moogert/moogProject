Sending emails right and left. Moog Music has very graciously donated (lent, really) some sweet CV-controlling
gear (as well as some other goodies :) to the project, so I'm looking forward to that with great excitement. 

Sourcing parts, planning on making a final order today or tomorrow. Filing for all sorts of grants and things, 
trying to get enough sleep/finish all the other school stuff that needs to be done. Talking with recording
studio to try and set up logistics; realizing I've never heard Misty (as it's been dubbed) on nice speakers. 

UPDATE: I ordered $100 or trigger cables/converters, bought the Bel-power units (at last) for some nice, 
clean power. Will work on potentiometer stuff tomorrow morning, I think. 

...and that's about it. More later.
