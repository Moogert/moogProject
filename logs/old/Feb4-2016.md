Spent time evaluating the Moog's left 901-B module. Attached an oscilloscope to the oscillator's outputs and evaluated it from the perspective of a function generator. 

The module itself does seem to generating reasonably (from a visual perspective) accurate waveforms, but acoustically, the unit is in need of significant repairs. 

I also played the oscillator module through a speaker- there were significant instabilities in tuning, leading to a very unpleasant sound. Diagnostics are forthcoming. 

I also communicated with some people online about the reverb unit. The advice I received was to replace the pots, as well as possibly replace the electrolytic caps. 

I also talked with Prof. Stacy Tamtum from ECE about the project. I will be in communication with some potential advisors in the coming days. 

All things considered, a very productive day.
