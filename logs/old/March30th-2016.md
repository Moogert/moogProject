Tested VCAs with Dewey Lawson. Both VCAs seem to work, no significant issues observed. 
Both linear and exponential model work, all CV inputs seem to perfom perfectly. As a 
side note, the amplifiers seem to overdrive very nicely, giving some very pleasing 
lower frequencies. (Not sure if that's overdrive or normal behavior, but it sounds like 
overdrive, so I shall, for the moment, term is as such.)

Power issues are still keeping me from figuring out the envelope generator, but I think
that should be resolved soon. 

Pots need to be cleaned for both VCAs, but I don't think that's going to be an issue. 

Low-pass filter is no longer functional, no idea why. Details to follow. 

Good day. Here's to more like it.
