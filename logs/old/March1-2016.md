Today I obtained a power supply from Justin Miles in ECE. IF all goes 
according to plan, this will allow me to construct a test rig for the
Moog, which will let me get around the power supply issue for the time 
being. 

The forums have proved useful- from one anonymous Internet entity known 
only by the moniker "robotmakers:"

I've modified Bel Power / Power One supplies to produce all the voltages in two vintage Moog systems, and the results are excellent. Hum is reduced - even proximity induced hum in the 905 reverbs is reduced/eliminated. Supply voltage variation is minimized which should also help tuning. 

Highly recommended, even if the old supplies can be repaired. Just one resistor in each of the supplies needs to be replaced with a jumper, and you'd get the +12v, -10v and -6v you need. In addition, because the -10v is regulated (unlike the vintage Moog supply), you can add a few modern modules to the system. For example, I run some Moon modules in one Moog system off the +12v/-10v supply without issue. 

HB5-3/OVP-AG supply normally provides 5V @ 3A. By replacing R7 with a jumper, you can dial in -6V with the trimmer potentiometer 

HBB15-1.5-AG supply normally provides +/-12V @ 1.7A. By replacing R27 with a jumper, you can dial in -10V in addition to the +12V 

Cheers,

the HB5-3/OVP-AG power supply runs at about $60- the HBB15-1.5-AG supply runs about $80. 
It would seem that replacing the power supply, while certainly not the most convenient 
option, would certainly be an option not entirely outside the scope of this project.
