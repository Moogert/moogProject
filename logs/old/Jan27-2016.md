Investigated the power supply, made contact with organizers of ECE Undergraduate Laboratory 
for equipment and expertise. Had a discussion with Andrew Diao about approaches to evaluating
PSU's reliability. A meeting will likely be set up to make a more formal evaluation within the 
next week. 

Queries were also made regarding empirical studies on human interactions with electronic 
instruments. While these studies are unlikely to play the largest part in the project's 
evolution, they will likely be helpful. An inquiry was also made to Small Town Records (Duke's 
record label) regarding the final musical result of this project.
