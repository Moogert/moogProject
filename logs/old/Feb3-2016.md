Today, I opened up the modular unit and pulled the 905 reverb unit and the 904-A low-pass filter out. 
These modules are crucial to the Moog's sound, and the process of troubleshooting is reasonably well-documented. 

The spring reverb has some issues with it. See this YouTube video for a demo:

I will confer with some folks on various forums and see if there are any solutions out there.
