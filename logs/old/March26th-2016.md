Finally got capacitors ordered. Should arrive pretty soon. Going to try and reconcile 
Moog and eurorack trigger standards (goal is to not blow anything up). 

## UPDATE: [though technically this should be in the logs as the 27th] 

found some more resources on trigger standards, sent an email to synthesizers.com
folks to see what they think about buying their product. I've got a pretty good 
shot (IMO) of successfully reconciling the Moog standards with the Eurorack 
standards (assuming that they differ in any significant ways, I think there's 
actually going to be more overlap than I originally thought). 

strongly considering constructing (as a Eurorack module) a converter 
that deals with gate + CV if I end up needing it. (because I'm not sure I'll need it 
in the end). another wild saturday night 

More soon. At an engineering conference. #sobriety
