Emailed Justin Miles (ECE lab manager) about getting access to a power 
soruce while the Moog's is being troubleshot. Posted to forums about 
finding a solution to present issues. 

Measured voltage to modules, 0V on all measurements taken. I honestly
have no idea why this is the case, will be moving forward on different
fronts while this gets sorted out. The rationale for replacing the 
power source becomes stronger by the way (though it should be noted that
this is offset by the nightmare that rewiring everything would be). 

I expect to have a Gantt chart for this project completed soon. 

More soon.
