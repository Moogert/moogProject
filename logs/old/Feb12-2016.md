Things have been busy. (I got sick, and was battling a lot of fatigue.) 

I'm back in the saddle now, and went through all the documentation that I have 
on file. I found out that the system we have is a 1968 modular system ("Synthesizer
1"), which is primarily an educational model. It's not designed to map out the sonic
universe in great detail, which explains a good bit of its functionality, but it is 
still a good synth. 

I looked into the keyboard controller for the Moog; I think it should be reasonably 
straightforward to test its functionality. There is a tuning module that we might be 
able to emulate using digital means. (Though, honestly, I think we should just focus 
on getting more up-to-date interfaces for this thing.) 

Most of the work done today related to getting documentation sorted out.
