OK, so today was a good day. I hooked up the power source correctly (bench power) 
and plugged in the oscillators. I got noise (!), which was very encouraging, 
and made me very happy. (A video of me screaming like a 5-year-old at the glorious 
noise of three stacked oscillators can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KOKWHhS9V0 ) 

Tested filter bank; some filter bands don't work. Will ask why online (I suspect broken pots?). 

1000, 2800, 500, bands on the filter bank are not functional. I suspect bad pots, will get to 
cleaning those soon. It's been a good day.
