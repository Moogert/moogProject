Today I talked more about getting parts ordered. Looking into getting the 
950 restored (which is not the biggest of my worried right now, though it 
would be good to get access to some kind of MIDI-CV converter soon so I 
can test the oscillators soon). 

Next up is to reconcile trigger voltages (hopefully with eurorack).
