Today I worked some more on getting the documentation system up and running. It's not very 
pretty as of right now (I'm working with Jekyll, which seems to be determined to not 
comply with my desires). 

I did find documentation for the (previously unidentified) CV routing module. 

[I did more, but forgot to document it.]
