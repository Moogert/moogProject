Today I met with Dr. Bill Seaman to discuss interfaces with the Moog upon its 
restoration. The meeting lasted about an hour, and touched on a wide variety of 
possible approaches to the project. Dr. Seaman encouraged further contact should 
I have any further questions. 

Today's emphasis was on the Moog's power supply. (Without electricity, there 
is no synth, and the rest of one's efforts are rendered moot.) Various parties were 
contacted to ascertain a means of evaluating the PSU's functionality. Original 
documentation was consulted for optimal voltage outputs. 

Further interfaces between the Moog and the Seaboard Roli were briefly investigated.
