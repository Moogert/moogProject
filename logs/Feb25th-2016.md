Today I changed out the fuse and fuse holder, and obtained some 
more tools for the project. upon changing the fuse, the CV routing 
modules began to function, which was a great improvement. I wonder
what else works as a result of this repair (who can say I suppose). 

One issue I'm having is that power does not seem to be delivered to 
the oscillator section. I suspect that this is an internal wiring 
problem, though it seems curious that this began since the beginning
of repairs.
