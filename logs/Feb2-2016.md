I've fallen behind a bit on the logs. Things have been progressing; I now have: 

* An oscilloscope, soldering station, frequency generator, and other tools to proceed with repairs and quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis through technical means is preferred, since (for a filter, for example) it is preferable to be able to view on a time-based frequency spectrum chart than to say "well, it doesn't seem to sound right." 

* I have been in contact with the manufacturers at Roli about implementing their product (Roli Rise) as an interface. They have provided technical advice on possible implementations; this advice will be evaluated over the next few days and contextualized for this project (there are some differences between the voltage standards that may need to be reconciled). 

* Progress is being made on the online update system- there have been a few setbacks but I hope to have this up and running very soon.
