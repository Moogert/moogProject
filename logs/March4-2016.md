Today was a productive day. Met with Martin Brooke, troubleshot power supply. 
Established that transformer does indeed still work, issue most likely lies 
blown capacitors (surprised they didn't blow earlier- par for the course, 
really). 

removed power supply, opened it up, cataloged and observed. PSU is not extraordinarily
complex, but there's work to be done for sure. Will probably source transistors 
and diodes soon (full reconstruction isn't the worst thing that could happen). 

Internal wiring of Moog is a mystery; I have no schematics , meaning that any 
info will be deducted from our specific model. 

I cataloged all the capacitors we have, and will begin sourcing those soon. 
Meanwhile, I'm trying to work out a good way to make a makeshift power supply
to troubleshoot individual components. Will send some more emails on this. 

Things are looking good, but there's work to do.
